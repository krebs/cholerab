request/response as this section demonstrates.

## Request

    POST /namespace HTTP/1.1
    Host: krebs:1337
    Content-Type: application/vnd.krebs.clive-2+json
    
    { "method": "taunt", "params": "lol", "id": 42 }


## Positive Response

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    
    { "result": true, "id": 42 }


## Negative Response
Negative responses should reflect the JSON-RPC error as hard as possible.

    HTTP/1.1 400 You are made of stupid!
    
    { "error": {
        "code": 1,
        "message": "You are made of stupid!"
      },
      "id": 42
    }
